      <div id="pov"><h4>I grew up in a small town in China where people were unaware of the value of design. It wasn't until I owned my first Apple product that I was introduced to the concept; I became enamored by the fact that the product in my hands was both simple and innovative. I was driven by curiosity to discover more about simplicity in design. This is when I was introduced to Muji, a company that conceives designs that are user-friendly.</h4><br> <h4>I believe that, not unlike the Buddhist teachings, simplicity is like an empty vessel that opens to accept a person's thoughts and feelings. It is with this idea that I hope I can approach true user-centric design by reaching into the endless possibilities of simplicity. The concept of simplicity behind design pushed me to journey to San Francisco to study design, and after the three years of professional training at the California College of the Arts, I want to continue to grow my knowledge of and passion for the principles of simplicity to utilize in my future professional design practice. </h4>
